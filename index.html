        <h1>Hello, English 388!</h1>
        <p>My name is Annie Melnick. I am a third-year undergraduate at the University of Washington, where I am studying English Language and Literature. With a planned graduation for next spring, I hope to either break into the publishing industry as an editor, or pursue a career in copywriting. My primary interest is reading (which is probably obvious given my major), and I enjoy dystopian literature and historical fiction in particular. I also love watching competition reality shows (including Survivor, Big Brother, Top Chef, and the Amazing Race), playing board games, hiking, and exploring new restaurants and cafes in the Seattle area.</p>
