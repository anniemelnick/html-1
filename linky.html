        <p>This is a list of songs that critics have voted the "worst" at one point. After looking at this list, I've concluded that it's a list of songs that were popular when they came out, but can be considered quite annoying in retrospect. I would definitely agree with some of the tracks on this list: "Ice Ice Baby" by Vanilla Ice, "Achy Breaky Heart" by Billy Ray Cyrus, "You're Beautiful" by James Blunt (just to name a few). But I actually like some of the songs on this list, whether its due to nostalgia ("Baby" by Justin Bieber) or its genuinely a catchy song ("What's Up?" by 4 Non Blondes).</p>
